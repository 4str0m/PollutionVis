# France pollution visualization

This application is an easy to use visualization tool, allowing users to explore and compare pollution measurements in France.
With its intuitive interface, you can navigate in on a map of France, selecting one or multiple data points and inspecting the associated measurements. Filtering the wanted pollution types is as easy as toggling a checkbox.
